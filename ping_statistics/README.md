## Introduction

A tool to analyze ping output:  
1. Pakcets Counts & Round-Trip Time:
    a. # of packets transmitted 
    b. # of packets received
    c. # of packets lost
    d. % of packets loss
    e. RTT min
    f. RTT avg
    g. RTT max
    h. RTT stddev (standard deviation)
2. Percentile Calculation 
    a. Constraints: 
        Input one or more integers between 0-100
3. Consecutive Timeouts
    a. Notice:
        a1. Exclude the timed-out packets that occur before the 1st successful ping packet. 
            (As in test02.txt, ignore timeouts before line 7.)
        a2. Exclude the timed-out packets that occur after the last successful ping packet. 
            (As in test02.txt, ignore timeouts before line 46.)
    b. Constraints: 
        Input one integer
4. Lost-Packets during a Time-Period (How many packets were lost during the requested time period?)
    a. Constraints: 
        a1. Input one or more integer values
        a2. The minimum value for the duration of time should be at least 1.
        a3. The maximum value for the duration of time would be the max packets of the input file.
5. Output to output.csv file by default
    a. For Lost-Packet during a Time-Period section, it would only include:
        a1. The number of incidents that happened 
        a2. The max number for the lost packets

## Instruction

1. Install requirement

```console
% pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


2. Run As:

a. Help:

```console
% python3 ping_statistics.py -h                                                  
usage: ping_statistics.py [-h] [-p PERCENTILES] [-t TIMEOUT] [-c COUNT] [-o OUTPUT] filenames

Ping Statistics

positional arguments:
  filenames             List the files that contain(s) ping outputs, sepearted by ','

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PERCENTILES, --percentiles PERCENTILES
                        List percentile value(s) (0-100), sepearted by ','
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Enter an Integer for the MAX Consecutive Timeout Packet(s)/Second(s)
  -c COUNT, --count COUNT
                        Enter a list of number(s) for the duration of time period, sepearted by ','
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Enter the output filename (.csv)
```

b. Example 1:

```console
% python3 ping_statistics.py test02.txt,test01.txt -t 10 -p 20,50 -c 5,20
